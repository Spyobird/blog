When I started my funemployment posts last week, I had a mentality that I should be maximising each and every day of my break. But as the days went by I was doing a lot of things but not appreciating life. And now, merely a week later, I have a paradigm shift. That one could be productive without filling up your day with activity. Not that we should waste our time and laze around, but that maximising was no longer the top priority. And with that, I found a deeper appreciation for flexibility.

### The treasure in flexibility

I think the one greatest thing about being unemployed — which also applies to people on school break — is lifestyle flexibility. I think flexibility is something young people — not leaving out myself — don’t appreciate enough, and older working people all aspire to regain. By lifestyle flexibility, I mean the ability to organise some part of you schedule — like weekly or monthly — to do what you want to do. The greatest revelation I had today is the hidden value of flexibility, it is truly a treasure waiting to be realised.

### Flexibility is not idleness

I think it is easy to have an idealistic view of what flexibility is. We all see those digital nomads, influencers, and successful people with a 3-day work week and we dream that that is the life to live. But I don’t think flexibility involves doing less, but instead there is a freedom of choosing what we want to do. If we think of our own personal schedules, maybe our lives are filled with clutter from various work commitments. We have fixed things we have to do on fixed dates. I think what flexibility looks like is not having no clutter, but having good clutter. Flexibility is not idleness, but an initiative to do what we choose to.

### Choose what is important

The greatest benefit to flexibility is choice, but how do we know what to choose? I think there is an intrinsic sense of value that you place in certain things, and my opinion is that you should choose what you value more. Perhaps we would choose to spend time with our family rather than go study for three more hours. It is a question of what you value more. A good handle I have learnt is to ask yourself this question, “am I stressed by my schedule?” If the answer is yes, then maybe we need a shift in our perspective of productivity. Maybe we need to reconsider what values we hold dear.

### Me talking about my day (and hopefully linking it back)

So today, I had nothing much planned for the day. I was just gonna practice some piano in the morning and then go climbing in the evening. I had my schedule flexible in the afternoon. So I had a three hour practice session in the morning, and ate my lunch directly after. While I was eating, I was contemplating what to do in the afternoon. Then I thought, hang on, I really enjoyed my time playing piano in the morning, what is wrong with just continuing it. And that is what I did, for another three hours, with a short break in between to take a walk and get some coffee. From this, I learnt the value was not just in playing piano — which I do find quite fun — because our excitement for things can fade, but there was value in choosing what I felt was valuable to do in the moment. That I think, is flexibility. It’s not that I was equally excited about piano the whole way through, if not I wouldn’t have decided to take a break and go for a walk, but instead the option of choosing to be able to take a break has value in itself.

I do hope I will continue to appreciate my flexible schedule while I still have it. I have no idea how I am to apply this to when I start a regular job. How will I organise my time so when so much of one’s day is dictated by the commitments of work, so that I can be flexible in other portions of the day? I have a hypothesis, that saying no to things help. In the sense of not cluttering up one’s schedule before one has valued something, for there are always other alternatives to consider.
